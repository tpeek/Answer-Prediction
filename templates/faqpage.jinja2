		<p id="about">Four Days, Four Guys, Multiple Linear Regression<br><br>
		Sherlock Engine is a python based application which uses multiple linear regression
		to predict what the user's answer will be to the next question. Each time a user
		answers, the prediction becomes more accurate for that user as well as for all other
		users. It is based off the idea that everything is correlated, even if only by a
		small amount. If you have enough information about many individuals in a population,
		you can make accurate predictions about any single individual in that population.</p>
