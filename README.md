# Answer-Prediction
Authors: Tyler Peek, Wesley Wooten, James Hemmaplardh, Jesse Klein


## Summary:
A Code Fellows group project, completed in one week by four students. Sherlock Engine is a Python based application which uses multiple linear regression to predict what a user's answer will be to the next question. Each time a user submits an answer, the predicted answer for all subsequent questions becomes more accurate for that user as well as for all other users. It is based off the idea that everything is correlated, even if only by a small amount. If you have enough information about many individuals in a population, you can make accurate predictions about any single individual in that population.
