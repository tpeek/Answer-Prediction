# Answer-Prediction
Authors: Tyler Peek, Wesley Wooten, James Hemmaplardh, Jesse Klein
Summary:
A Code Fellows group project. A website will be made where a user can log in and answer fun, interesting and random questions. Using the user's previous answers and the data gathered from other users, the website will use correlations to predict what answers the user will pick. As the user answers more questions and the database gets more information about how other users answer, the preditions will become more accurate.
