# Answer-Prediction
Authors: Tyler Peek, Wesley Wooten, James Hemmaplardh, Jesse Klein


## Summary:
A Code Fellows group project. Sherlock Engine is a python based application which uses multiple linear regression to predict what the user's answer will be to the next question. Each time a user answers, the prediction becomes more accurate for that user as well as for all other users. It is based off the idea that everything is correlated, even if only by a small amount. If you have enough information about many individuals in a population, you can make accurate predictions about any single individual in that population.
